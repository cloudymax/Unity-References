# Zoom BAckground Maker

```md
project that I use to make video backgrounds for zoom calls.

consists of:

- 3d environement w/ colliders
- HDRP lighting setup w/ light and reflection probes
- UI system for controlling the post processing and scene lights
- fun video texture integrations and mood items like bloom and flicker

* Relies on enlighten which Unity is dericating and as of the last updat has not published a new solution.
IMO if you want realtime GI, grab a VXGI solution like NVIDIA's or SonicEthers
then just run the game at a low res and rely on the new amd upsampeling
- otherwise good luck you brave soul.
